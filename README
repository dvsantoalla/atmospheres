* Some readings

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification
See doc directory too

* Fundamental points

- Music that is artistically valid on its own accord, not just as 
  "sonification" of data or as an "aural visualization" of atmosphere phenomena.
- Music must create emotion. A sense of drama
- Emotions created by the music will be related to the emotions future weather will create in people (here is were the real value is)
- Music will forecast emotions
- Music avances how you will feel in the future
- Will show a connection between the earth and the emotions
- We are one with the world ;)
- Time travel

* General ideas

Music that relates to events in the future
Music that follows patterns of the Earth (eg day/night, rain/dry, cloudy/sunny, hot/warm)
Granular synthesis. Waves vs particles
Music that is unique for a moment. Disposable, ephemeral art. Fluxus, Beuys. No one should listen to the same piece twice as they always can access the latest. 
Music as Ephemera https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemera
Programmatic music, following day movements
Computer generated compositional techniques
Weather makes us feel time, seasons are the reason for the first calendars. Feel the passing of
time, different timescales..
The concepts of stable/unstable belong both in music and in meteorology

* Examples of weather in music

- Good vibrations
- Rain (Beatles)
- Winterreise
- Sunny Afternoon

* Parameter to musical concept mappings

- Cloud Cover: 		Some kind of low-pass filter that opens as the cloud cover lifts?
- Precipitation:	Harmonic stability? Key-related. But might be difficult to "establish key" though
- Wind Speed:		Harmonic stability? Intra-chordal? From 8ths to 5ths to minor 2nds
- 2m Temperature:	Grain of the synth. From sharper to rounder
- ????				Amplitude
- Uncertainty in all the prior? The uncertainty could be mapped so that it increases the musical complexity of the piece
	adding more instruments or adding wider variations. This would correlate with the many many musical pieces are 
	laid out, developing themes and introducing variations as time moves forward.
- Deviation from climate data. How unusual are these values for the month?
- What for Rhythm? The grind between a 2-based and a 3,4,5,6,7.. Polyrhythms. Rhythmic tension between stable/unstable beats
- Use Shepard tones (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone) to convey a send of continues ascension or descension
- Changes in modes could be useful as ways of conveying meaning? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music)

* Technical issues

- Required python modules

 - matplotlib for debugging and showing off
 - scipy
 - Csound for realtime playing or batch-mode (generate orchestra+score then render)?
