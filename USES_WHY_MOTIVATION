Sonification
- Sight-impaired people. Emphasis in clarity then
- Alternative way of representing data

Consumer use cases
- An alarm clock that plays the forecast for the day
- Music for a trip. Sound track

Artistic motivations
- "Because it is there"
- Creating something new
- Generating music that aligns with the Earth
- Discovering "the beat of the earth". Macro escale oscilations. Sound is oscilation. Use the oscilations of the Earth's atmosphere as a kind of LFO
- Connect the music to the emotions of the user with regards to the present, past and future weather. How do we react when confronted with sun, rain, high and low temperatures, wind, etc. In a more abstract note, how does "a day like that" sound.
- Such a processor would generate almost infinite musical variations that would be almost impossible to repeat. In this sense is comparable to "random music", only without the randomness. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music
